Description: This package provides a simple interactive application for 
    investigating the effect of confounding between a signal of interest 
    and a batch effect. It uses simulated data with user-specified effect
    sizes for both batch and condition effects. The user can also specify 
    the number of samples in each condition and batch, and thereby the 
    degree of confounding.
